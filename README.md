# Option-Pricing
Option Pricing using Binomial Trees In Python
In this repository, I will be uploading my Python codes for calculating the price of an option using Binomial Trees

The various types that I will attempt to cover are:
a. Put & Call options
b. American & European Options
c. Knock-in & Knock-Out barriers
d. Cash-or-nothing option

Scope for future work:
Create a user interactive interface using web based Java applet which looks more visually appealing
